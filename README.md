BPlayblast is an addon for Blender that aims to add playblast tools for fast animation previews. Based on [lucianomunoz](https://github.com/lucianomunoz)'s [Advanced Boomsmash](https://github.com/lucianomunoz/AdvancedBoomsmash), it uses the viewport's OpenGL rendering system and gives a few tools.

Supposed to work on Blender 2.93

## WORK IN PROGRESS

For now the developement is only about transitionning from Luciano's script made for Blender 2.71 into a stable copy that works on the current stable Blender release: 2.93.

## To-do

- turn Luciano's 2.71 script into a 2.80+ compatible script

- customize the UI

- add some rendering options (wireframe, AO, AA, maybe even freestyle)

- add simple file format settings
